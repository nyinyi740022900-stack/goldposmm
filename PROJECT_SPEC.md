## 1. Product Overview

An **offline-first Point-of-Sale (POS) application for Myanmar retailers** (grocery, minimarts, pharmacies, phone/accessory shops, teashops). It runs on Android and iOS phones/tablets, works fully without internet, and syncs to the cloud when a connection is available.

### 1.1 Core value

- **Works with no internet.** All core operations (sell, add stock, print receipt) function offline. Sync is opportunistic.
- **Cheap hardware friendly.** Targets low-end Android devices and Bluetooth thermal mini-printers (58mm/80mm ESC/POS) common in Myanmar.
- **Myanmar-first UX.** Full Burmese (my) + English (en) localization, Myanmar Kyat (MMK) currency, local date formats, and payment methods (KBZPay, WavePay, AYAPay, CBPay, cash).
- **Subscription licensed.** Online license activation with offline grace period; supports local payment collection.

### 1.2 Non-goals (v1)

- No multi-branch consolidated accounting (single shop per license in v1; multi-device same-shop sync is in scope).
- No full ERP / payroll / supplier procurement automation.
- No web storefront / e-commerce.

---

## 2. Target Users & Devices

| Persona | Needs |
|---|---|
| Shop owner | Daily/period sales analytics, stock value, license & staff management |
| Cashier | Fast sell screen, barcode/qty entry, receipt printing, cash/mobile payment |
| Stock keeper | Add/adjust inventory, low-stock alerts, purchase entry |

- **OS:** Android 8+ (primary), iOS 14+ (secondary).
- **Form factor:** Phone (portrait) and tablet (landscape). Responsive layout required.
- **Printer:** Bluetooth ESC/POS thermal, 58mm & 80mm paper.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Offline-first principle

```
                 ┌─────────────────────────── Device (source of truth) ──────────────────────────┐
   UI (Flutter)  →  Riverpod controllers  →  Repositories  →  Drift (SQLite)  →  Outbox table
                                                                     │                  │
                                                                     │ (read models)    │ (queued mutations)
                                                                     ▼                  ▼
                                                              Reactive streams     SyncEngine
                                                                                        │  (when online + licensed)
                                                                                        ▼
                                                                                   Supabase (Postgres/RLS)
```

- The **UI never talks to the network directly.** It reads/writes Drift. Repositories enqueue changes to an **outbox**; the `SyncEngine` drains the outbox and pulls remote changes on a schedule / connectivity change.
- **Conflict policy (v1):** last-write-wins by `updated_at` (server clock authoritative on push ack). Money-critical rows (sales) are **append-only** and never updated after finalization to avoid conflicts; corrections are separate reversal records.

### 4.2 Layered structure

```

### 4.3 Money & rounding

- Store money as **integer minor units? No** — MMK has no widely used minor unit; store as integer **kyat** (`int`). A `Money` value object wraps `int amountKyat`. All arithmetic in integers to avoid float drift. Display with thousands separators.

---

## 5. Data Model (v1)

All tables carry: `id` (uuid), `shop_id` (uuid), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_deleted` (bool, tombstone), `dirty` (local-only sync flag).

- **shops** — id, name, address, phone, currency='MMK', logo, receipt_footer.
- **staff** — id, shop_id, name, pin_hash, role (owner/cashier/stock), active.
- **categories** — id, shop_id, name, sort.
- **products** — id, shop_id, name, sku, barcode, category_id, cost_price, sale_price, unit, image, is_active.
- **stock_levels** — product_id, quantity (int), reorder_level. (Denormalized current qty; movements are the ledger.)
- **stock_movements** — id, product_id, type (purchase/sale/adjustment/return), qty_delta, unit_cost, ref_id, note.
- **sales** — id, shop_id, invoice_no, staff_id, subtotal, discount, tax, total, paid, change, payment_method, customer_name?, note, finalized_at. **Append-only.**
- **sale_items** — id, sale_id, product_id, name_snapshot, price_snapshot, qty, line_total.
- **payments** — id, sale_id, method (cash/kbzpay/wavepay/ayapay/cbpay), amount, ref_no.
- **licenses** — id, shop_id, key, plan (monthly/yearly), status (active/expired/grace), activated_at, expires_at, device_id, last_verified_at.

**Supabase RLS:** every table scoped by `shop_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'shop_id'`. No cross-shop reads.

---

## 6. Licensing & Subscription

- **Model:** one license key → one shop, bound to a primary device_id at activation. Plans: monthly / yearly.
- **Activation flow:** enter key → Edge Function `activate(key, device_id)` validates + binds → returns signed license payload → stored locally.
- **Offline grace:** app works offline; license re-verified when online. If `expires_at` passed AND last successful verify > **7-day grace**, app enters **read-only** mode (can view, cannot finalize sales) until renewed.
- **Local payment support:** owner can record a renewal payment (KBZPay/Wave/cash) which flags the license for manual/automated reconciliation server-side. (Automated gateway integration is a later phase.)
- **Anti-abuse:** device binding, server-side expiry authoritative, key never trusted from client alone.

### 6.1 Referral commission (Phase 6)

- **Model:** single-level. Every license carries a shareable `referral_code` (`REF-XXXX`). A new shop may enter a referrer's code in its subscription request (`license_requests.referred_by_code`).
- **Accrual (payment-tied only):** each time a referred shop's payment is fulfilled (admin `fulfill_request`), the referrer earns a commission = `paid_amount × referral.rate` (default 15%, in `app_config`). One immutable row per paid request in `referral_commissions`, deduped by a unique `source_request_id`. **No commission is ever created for recruitment alone** — this keeps it a legitimate affiliate program, not a pyramid scheme.
- **Payout = license credit:** the referrer redeems the accumulated balance into whole months on their own license via `redeem_referral_balance()` (self-service, whole `price.monthly` units; remainder stays as balance). Draws recorded in `referral_redemptions`; balance = earned − redeemed.
- **RLS:** a shop reads only its own `referrals` / commissions / redemptions (`referrer_shop_id = auth_shop_id()`); balance readout via SECURITY DEFINER `my_referral_balance()`. All writes are service-role (admin Edge Function) or the definer RPCs.
- **App surface:** Settings → *Refer & earn* — running earnings wallet, progress toward the next free month, one-tap redeem, code share.
- **Commission alert:** a local notification (`flutter_local_notifications`, no FCM) fires when the server-side earned total grows — polled at launch, on resume, and every 30 min, deduped by a `referral.seen_earned` watermark. Delivered next time the app opens; true background push is a later phase.
- **Admin tooling:** a **Referrals** tab in the admin dashboard ([`lib/admin/`](lib/admin/)) — commissions grouped by referrer (lifetime earned + payment count) with one-click **Apply credit** (`apply_referral_credit`), plus the raw referral links. Commission rate/toggle editable under **Config** (`referral.rate`, `referral.enabled`).

---

## 7. Bluetooth Receipt Printing

- ESC/POS command generation via `esc_pos_utils_plus`; transport via `print_bluetooth_thermal`.
- Support 58mm (32 char) and 80mm (48 char) profiles — configurable in settings.
- Receipt includes: shop name/logo, address/phone, invoice no, datetime, cashier, line items (name/qty/price/total), subtotal/discount/total, payment method + change, footer text, optional QR.
- **Burmese text on thermal printers** is a known hard problem (many printers lack Myanmar font). Strategy: render the receipt (or the Burmese portions) to a **bitmap image** and print as raster, so any Unicode renders correctly regardless of printer font support. English/numeric parts may use native text mode for speed.

---

## 8. Internationalization

- Languages: **en**, **my** (Burmese, Unicode — NOT Zawgyi). ARB files under `lib/l10n/`.
- All user-facing strings via generated `AppLocalizations`. No hardcoded strings in widgets.
- Numbers/currency: MMK formatting, optional Myanmar digit display toggle.
- QA workstream owns translation completeness + accuracy verification (see §11).

---

## 9. Security

- Supabase Auth (anonymous/device session bootstrapped by license activation).
- **RLS on every table.** Server never trusts client-supplied `shop_id`; derived from JWT.
- Staff PIN stored as salted hash (e.g. `bcrypt`/`argon2` via crypto lib) — never plaintext.
- Secrets (Supabase anon key is public by design; service key NEVER in app). Edge Functions hold privileged logic.
- Input validation on Edge Functions. Rate-limit `activate`.
- Local DB: consider SQLCipher for at-rest encryption (phase 3).

---

## 10. Delivery Phases

> Build order. Each phase ends in a runnable, demoable state. Spec updated per phase.

- **Phase 0 — Foundation (scaffold):** Flutter project, folders, theme, Riverpod, go_router, l10n (en/my), Drift DB skeleton, Supabase client config, CI-friendly analysis options. *Runnable empty-shell app.*
- **Phase 1 — Inventory:** categories + products CRUD, stock levels, low-stock alerts, barcode field, offline persistence. Seed/demo data.
- **Phase 2 — Sales / Sell screen:** cart, qty/discount, checkout, payment method, finalize sale (append-only), stock decrement, invoice number generation. Offline.
- **Phase 3 — Invoices & Bluetooth printing:** receipt model, ESC/POS generation, printer pairing/settings, Burmese raster fallback, reprint.
- **Phase 4 — Sync engine:** Supabase schema + RLS migrations, outbox drain, pull/merge, connectivity handling, conflict rules.
- **Phase 5 — Licensing:** licenses table, `activate` Edge Function, activation UI, grace/read-only enforcement, local renewal payment record.
- **Phase 6 — Analytics:** sales dashboards (daily/period), top products, profit (sale−cost), stock value, fl_chart visualizations.
- **Phase 7 — Hardening:** tests, security review, i18n QA pass, at-rest encryption, performance on low-end devices, release builds.

## 11. Workstreams (the three sub-agent roles)

### 11.1 Frontend / UX
- Responsive layouts (phone portrait + tablet landscape), Material 3 theme, Myanmar-appropriate typography (Pyidaungsu/Noto Sans Myanmar).
- Fast, low-friction sell screen; big tap targets; works one-handed.
- Consistency: shared widgets, spacing scale, theme tokens.

### 11.2 Backend / Security
- Supabase schema, RLS policies, Edge Functions (`activate`, sync helpers).
- Sync engine correctness, conflict handling, outbox reliability.
- License auth, device binding, vulnerability patching, secret hygiene.

### 11.3 QA / Spec
- Keep THIS file in sync with code every change.
- Translation accuracy (en/my) — no missing keys, correct Burmese.
- Functional + unit/widget tests; bug triage; release checklist.

---

## 13. Security Review (Phase 7)

Manual review of the current codebase. Status: no high-severity issues in app code.

**Good:**
- **No service-role key in the app.** Only the anon/publishable key ships (public
  by design). Privileged logic (device binding, `shop_id` claim) lives in the
  `activate` Edge Function, which alone uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- **RLS on every synced table**, scoped by `auth_shop_id()` from the JWT. The
  server never trusts a client-supplied `shop_id`.
- **License authority is server-side** — expiry/binding validated in the Edge
  Function; the client cache is advisory only.
- **Money is integer kyat** — no floating-point rounding on financial values.
- Anon key kept out of source (`env.local.json` gitignored).

**Action items before production (tracked):**
1. **Remove dev-open policies** (`0002_dev_open_policies.sql`) and the demo
   license seed; rely solely on the `shop_id`-claim RLS from `0001`/`0003`.
2. **At-rest DB encryption** — swap `sqlite3_flutter_libs` for
   `sqlcipher_flutter_libs` + a keystore-backed passphrase (deferred; documented).
3. **Rate-limit `activate`** (per-IP / per-key) to blunt key-guessing.
4. **Staff PIN hashing** — when staff login lands, store salted argon2/bcrypt
   hashes (schema already uses `pin_hash`, not plaintext).
5. Wire `FlutterError.onError` to a real crash reporter (e.g. Sentry) for release.

## 12. Change Log

| Date | Phase | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-20 | 9 | **Product photos (storefront catalog).** Products gain a public photo: new `products.image_url` (Drift v6→v7 + sync mapper + `0019_product_images.sql`) and a **public** `product-images` storage bucket (anyone reads, authenticated shop writes). The product editor gains a photo picker (`file_picker`) that uploads the image and stores its public URL (`upsertProduct` keeps the existing URL when none is supplied). The storefront web catalog now shows product images (image-forward cards with a graceful placeholder). `storefront` fn `catalog` returns `image_url`. 91 tests pass; storefront web build verified. NOTE: apply `0019` before photos sync. |
| 2026-07-20 | 9 | **Storefront payment-screenshot upload.** At guest checkout the customer sees the shop's KBZPay/WavePay numbers and can **attach a transfer screenshot** (`file_picker`, web). It uploads to a **private** `payment-proofs` storage bucket (anon INSERT-only policy — no listing/reading) and the path is stored on the order (`orders.payment_proof_path`, added to Drift schema v5→v6 + sync mapper + `0018_payment_proofs.sql`; the `storefront` fn's `submit_order` persists it). The shop views the screenshot in the Kanban order-detail sheet via a short-lived **signed URL** (`_PaymentProof` → `createSignedUrl`). 91 tests pass; storefront web build verified. NOTE: apply `0018` + redeploy `storefront` before uploads work. |
| 2026-07-20 | 9 | **B2B2C web storefront (foundation).** A new **Flutter Web** entrypoint (`lib/storefront/storefront_main.dart`, tree-shaken from the mobile app like the admin) that serves each shop's public catalog at a dynamic URL `/{slug}` — customers browse, build a cart, and place a **guest order** with no account. Backend: migration `0017_storefronts.sql` (`storefronts` table — slug/display/phone/address/pay numbers, owner-only RLS + `gen_storefront_slug()`), and a new **anon-callable `storefront` Edge Function** that uses the service role internally to (a) `catalog` → return a shop's active products by slug, (b) `submit_order` → insert an `orders`/`order_items` row with `channel='storefront'`. The browser only ever holds the anon key; RLS and secrets stay server-side. Mobile owner side: `StorefrontRepository` + Settings → **My web storefront** (owner-only) to publish (auto-generates the slug from the shop name), toggle enabled, and copy the shareable link. `flutter build web -t lib/storefront/storefront_main.dart` verified; 91 mobile tests still pass. FOUNDATION — remaining: payment-screenshot upload (Supabase Storage), per-shop theming/images, and deploying the web to its own Vercel project (update `storefrontBaseUrl`). NOTE: apply `0017` + `supabase functions deploy storefront` before it works. |
| 2026-07-20 | 8 | **Delivery carrier credentials card (admin).** New **Delivery** tab in the admin dashboard to manage carrier (Ninja Van / Royal Express / Other) API credentials — add/edit/delete, enable toggle, account id + base URL + API key. Secrets stay **server-side**: migration `0016_delivery_carriers.sql` creates `delivery_carriers` with RLS enabled and **no policy** (default-deny for anon/authenticated; only the service role via the `admin` Edge Function can touch it). New admin actions `list_carriers` (returns the key **masked** — `api_key_set` + `api_key_last4` only, never raw), `set_carrier` (upsert; only overwrites the stored key when a new non-empty one is supplied), `delete_carrier`. `AdminApi.listCarriers/setCarrier/deleteCarrier`. Admin web build verified. This is the credential-entry UI; actual waybill creation (future) will call the carrier API from an Edge Function so the key never reaches the client. NOTE: apply `0016` + redeploy `admin` before the tab works. |
| 2026-07-20 | 2 | **Role-based device modes (Owner / Cashier).** A device-local, PIN-gated operating mode (not synced — set by the owner, then hand the phone to staff). `SettingsRepository` gains `staff.role`/`staff.pin`; `StaffController` (`enterCashierMode`/`setPin`/`unlockOwner`) enforces the PIN when leaving cashier mode. Gating: Analytics is owner-only (lock placeholder for cashiers); Inventory add/edit is hidden for cashiers (browse-only); Settings has a Staff-mode card to switch modes + set PIN. `OwnerOnlyGate`/`CashierBadge`/`promptPin` in `staff_ui.dart`; `isOwnerProvider` drives the gates (defaults to owner while loading). 91 tests pass (added 4 role/PIN tests). en+my i18n. NOTE: this is a single-device operating mode, not backend multi-user auth — a foundation that can grow into per-staff accounts later. |
| 2026-07-20 | 1 | **Stock ledger completeness (offline-priority foundation).** Manual stock changes now record an append-only `stock_movements` row — `opening` on product create, `adjustment` (signed delta) on later edits — so the movement ledger is the complete authoritative history (it syncs append-only, never LWW). This is the basis for cross-channel stock reconciliation; the full "in-store/offline always wins" merge is deferred to land WITH the web storefront (§10), which is what introduces a second concurrent writer — resolving it now (single-writer) would risk live stock data with nothing to test against. 87 tests pass (added a ledger-movement test; updated 3 stock tests to scope assertions to `sale` movements). |
| 2026-07-20 | 1 | **Overselling guard (stock cap).** The cart is now stock-aware: `CartNotifier.addProduct`/`increment` take an optional `maxQty` (available stock) and refuse once the line hits it, returning `false`. The Sell grid caps at `p.quantity` and the Checkout qty-steppers cap at live stock (both show a "Only N in stock" snackbar when blocked). Only enforced when `track_stock` is on (invoice-only shops are unaffected). 86 tests pass (added 4 cart-cap tests). en+my i18n parity holds. |
| 2026-07-20 | 7 | **Order search + filters (Kanban).** The Orders board gains a filter header: a search box (matches customer name / phone / `ORD-` number) plus channel and payment-status filter chips (All + each). Filtering is a pure `groupOrdersForBoard(orders, {query, channel, payment})` function (side-effect-free, unit-tested) that the `ordersByStatusProvider` calls with three new `StateProvider`s (`orderSearchProvider`/`orderChannelFilterProvider`/`orderPaymentFilterProvider`); a clear-filters button resets all three. Empty states split: no orders at all → first-run prompt; filters match nothing → "no match". 82 tests pass (added 4 filter tests). en+my i18n parity holds. |
| 2026-07-20 | 7 | **Social Order Kanban.** New feature to manage orders arriving via social channels (Facebook/Viber/TikTok/phone) through a Kanban pipeline before they become an in-store sale. Two new synced Drift tables **`orders`** + **`order_items`** (schemaVersion 4→5 `createTable` migration; sync mappers with LWW — orders are **mutable** unlike append-only sales; Supabase `0015_social_orders.sql` **with `shop_isolation` RLS** on both). `OrdersRepository`: `saveOrder` (create/edit, replaces item set, computes `items_total`, per-shop/day `ORD-yyyyMMdd-NNN`), `setStatus` (drag between columns), `setPaymentStatus`, `deleteOrder` (tombstone), and **`convertToSale`** — the only path that writes stock: a delivered order becomes an append-only `sales` row (+ items, payment, stock movements) via the same accounting as `SalesRepository`, idempotent on `orders.sale_id`; free-text lines (no `product_id`) convert without touching stock. UI: 6th nav tab **Orders** → horizontally-scrolling Kanban board (`new/confirmed/packed/shipped/delivered` columns, `LongPressDraggable`+`DragTarget` to move, cards show customer/total/payment dot), order editor sheet (header + item rows + catalog product picker), detail sheet (move chips, convert-to-sale w/ payment-method pick, cancel/restore, delete). Full en+my i18n (parity test passes). 78 tests pass (added 8 orders-repo tests: save/status/edit/convert/idempotent/free-text/delete/outbox; smoke test updated to 6 tabs + overrides `ordersStreamProvider`). NOTE: `0015` not yet applied to live DB — run `supabase db push` before orders sync (feature works fully offline meanwhile). |
| 2026-07-13 | security | **Production RLS lockdown + removed the DEV seed key.** Review caught that `0002` had dropped `shop_isolation` on the 7 core tables when it added `dev_open`, so a bare "drop dev_open" would have left them policy-less (default-deny) and broken the app. Rewrote `0012` to **re-create `shop_isolation` on all 9 synced tables** while dropping `dev_open`, then applied + verified live: unauthorized/no-claim writes → 403, cross-shop writes → 403, own-shop writes → 201; `start_trial`/`activate` stamp the `shop_id` claim so legit users still sync. Deleted `DEMO-KEY-2026` from the live DB and removed its seed from `0003` (mint real keys via the admin console). Remaining before public launch: rotate the offline-license signing key locally (`tool/genkey.dart`) since the session-generated one is in the transcript. |
| 2026-07-13 | feat | **Offline signed-key licenses (Ed25519).** A shop with no connectivity can now activate + renew by pasting a signed code. Admin **Generate offline code** (`admin` fn `sign_offline`, signs with the `LICENSE_SIGNING_KEY_HEX` secret) mints `MMPOS1.<payload>.<sig>` carrying shop/plan/expiry + optional device binding. The app (`OfflineLicense`, `cryptography` pkg) verifies the signature against the embedded Ed25519 **public key** entirely offline — `activate()` detects the `MMPOS1.` prefix and validates locally with no network; re-verify skips these tokens. Keypair generated with `tool/genkey.dart` (public key in `offline_license.dart`; private key is a Supabase secret, never in the repo). Verified end-to-end: a token signed with the private key validates against the baked-in public key. Also fixed a misleading "Activation failed. Check your connection." shown when re-verifying a local trial (now skipped) + accurate error messages. 70 tests pass (added 4 offline-crypto tests). NOTE: the signing key generated during the build session is in the chat transcript — regenerate with `tool/genkey.dart` for real production and update both the app public key + the secret. |
| 2026-07-13 | hardening | **Architecture review fixes 1-7.** (1) Removed dead `recordRenewalPayment` + the legacy admin **Payments** tab/dialogs. (2) Split the two biggest widgets (`license_screen`, `admin_dashboard_screen`) into `part` files. (3) `device_id` now persists in the OS secure store (`flutter_secure_storage`) so it **survives reinstall** (no more license lock-out); new admin **Reset device binding** action (`reset_device`). (4) Production RLS lockdown: migration `0012_drop_dev_policies.sql` drops `dev_open` — paired with (5) a new **`start_trial` Edge Function** that server-tracks the one free trial per device (anti-farming) and stamps `app_metadata.shop_id`, so trial users still sync under `shop_isolation` (app falls back to a local trial offline). (6) License **auto re-verify** at launch + every 6h (picks up admin extensions/revocations). (7) Optional **Sentry** crash reporting (DSN-gated via `SENTRY_DSN`). 66 tests pass. NOTE — deploy order (user): `supabase functions deploy start_trial` + `deploy admin` → verify new installs sync → THEN `db push` (`0012`). |
| 2026-07-13 | feat | **Unified subscription flow + expiry reminder + extension history.** (1) Removed the separate "Record payment" renewal path — an active license now renews via the **same Subscribe dialog** (shop name pre-filled from the profile), so new + existing users use one flow. `fulfill_request` now **extends** the license if one is already bound to the request's device (else issues a new key), and logs the action. (2) Sell screen shows an amber **"license expires in N days"** banner (≤5 days, still sellable) that taps through to the License screen. (3) Renewals add to the **existing expiry** (already correct: `renew_license` uses `greatest(expires_at, now())`). (4) New `license_events` audit table (`0011`) — the `admin` function logs every issue/extend (fulfill + extend_by_device) — surfaced in a new admin **History** tab. 66 tests pass; migration `0011` applied; `admin` function + admin web redeployed. |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Free trial, App Reference ID, plan/expiry, admin extend-by-code.** Subscribe dialog: button renamed to "Subscribe" and success now shows a thank-you dialog ("access begins within 24 hours" + Viber). New **free one-time 2-month trial** (`LicenseController.startFreeTrial` → 60-day trial scoped to `trial-<device>`, guarded by a `license.trial_used` flag). License status card now shows the **plan** alongside the expiry date. New **App Reference ID / Shop Code** tile (the install's `deviceId`, a globally-unique v4 UUID, `deviceIdProvider`) shown + copyable — it already flows into subscribe requests + payments. Admin: **Extend by App Reference ID** app-bar action → new `admin` function action `extend_by_device` (finds the license bound to that device and renews it). 66 tests pass. NOTE pending (classifier-blocked): `supabase functions deploy admin` (for `extend_by_device`). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Self-service subscription (new user with no key).** The not-activated License screen now shows a "Don't have a key? Subscribe" section (when a backend is configured) → a request dialog collecting shop name, phone, plan (monthly/yearly + price), duration stepper, KBZPay/WavePay + pay-to card, amount, transaction id. `LicenseRequestService.submit` inserts into a new `license_requests` table (migration `0010`, RLS allows anon insert) with the device id. Admin console gains a **Requests** tab (pending count badge) → **Issue key** calls the new `admin` function action `fulfill_request` (generates a shop id, runs `create_license` with the shop name/plan/months, marks the request fulfilled + stores the issued key). So a brand-new user can pay + request online, and the admin verifies and issues the key (sent back via Viber). 66 tests pass. NOTE pending (classifier-blocked): `supabase db push` (`0009`+`0010`) + `supabase functions deploy admin`. |
| 2026-07-12 | fix | **Renewal payment shows the shop's own name in admin + dialog spacing.** The admin Payments list showed the internal `shop_id` (e.g. `demo-shop`) because the demo license's `shop_name` was null. Now the app sends the shop's own **Shop-profile name** with the renewal payment: new nullable `license_payments.shop_name` (Drift schema v3→v4 `addColumn` + sync mapper + Supabase `0009_license_payment_shop_name.sql`), populated in `LicenseController.recordRenewalPayment` from `SettingsRepository.shopProfile().name`; the `admin` function's `list_payments` prefers the payment's `shop_name` over the license's. Also fixed the renewal dialog: added spacing between the Amount and Transaction-ID fields (the floating label was overlapping the field border above). 66 tests pass. NOTE pending (classifier-blocked): `supabase db push` (`0009`) + `supabase functions deploy admin` (redeploy for the shop_name preference). |
| 2026-07-12 | fix | **Outbox sync no longer wedges on one bad row.** Recorded renewal payments weren't reaching the admin console because the live `license_payments` table was empty — the sync push drains the outbox strictly FIFO and **halted on the first failing row**, blocking every item behind it (a sale that failed to push before `0007`/`customer_phone` landed remotely would wedge the whole queue). `SyncEngine._push` now wraps each item in try/catch: a failing row records an attempt and stays queued while later rows (e.g. the license payment) still push. Verified: anon insert into `license_payments` is RLS-allowed (HTTP 201), so once the queue is unblocked the payment syncs and appears in the admin Payments tab for approval. 66 tests pass (added a queue-isolation regression test). Also: renewal dialog now has a −/+ duration stepper (N months / N years) with live total = unit price × qty; the chosen month count is saved on the payment note and pre-fills the admin approve dialog. |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **License renewal plans + admin console (Phase D).** App renewal dialog: monthly/yearly plan selector showing prices (from `app_config` `price.monthly`/`price.yearly` via `VendorConfig.priceMonthly/priceYearly`), amount auto-fills from the plan, methods limited to **KBZPay/WavePay**, plan saved on the payment note. Admin console (`lib/admin/`): new **Config** tab edits vendor config (KBZPay/Wave name+number, support Viber, renewal prices) via new Edge Function actions `get_config`/`set_config`; **Generate key** now takes a shop display name; **Payments** list + approve show the license's **device_id + shop_name** (function merges licenses into `list_payments`) and the approve dialog pre-fills months from the plan note (yearly→12). Migration `0008_admin_extras.sql`: `licenses.shop_name`, `create_license` gains `p_shop_name`, seeds `price.monthly`/`price.yearly`. 65 tests pass. Deployed: migrations `0007`+`0008` (db push), admin web redeployed to Vercel. NOTE: `supabase functions deploy admin` **pending** (classifier blocked) — the Config tab + device/shop on payments need it; until then those admin actions return `unknown_action`. |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Credit settlement + analytics navigation (Phase C).** Credit-book repayments are now allocated to invoices: `CreditRepository.owedBySale` distributes each customer's repayments across their credit invoices **oldest-first** and returns remaining-owed per sale id (`creditOwedBySaleProvider`). Invoices "Credit" filter + badge + owed amount, and the credit-customer detail's per-invoice owed, all use this — so once a debt is paid off in the credit book the invoice's credit **disappears** (drops from the Credit filter, shows settled), even though sale rows stay append-only. Analytics KPI cards are now tappable: Revenue/Sales/Collected → Invoices (`context.go('/invoices')`), Stock value → Inventory, Credit outstanding → Credit book (push). 65 tests pass (added 2 FIFO-allocation tests). Also: barcode scan added to the Inventory product-edit form (scan icon on the Barcode field fills it). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Barcode scanning (Phase B).** Added `mobile_scanner` (7.2.0). Sell app-bar gains a scan action → full-screen `BarcodeScannerScreen` (torch + camera-flip + viewfinder, `noDuplicates`, pops the first decoded value). `SellScreen._scanAndAdd` looks the code up against `products.barcode`: match → adds to cart with a snackbar; no match → drops the code into the Sell search box. iOS `NSCameraUsageDescription` added; iOS deployment target bumped 13→15 (mobile_scanner 7 requirement; Podfile + all pbxproj configs). Android camera permission comes from the plugin manifest. 63 tests pass (scanner is camera UI — verified on device, not unit-tested). Also refined Phase A: the "Ask for customer" control moved out of Settings into an inline per-sale **"Add customer"** switch on the checkout sheet (forced on + locked, name required, for credit / partial-payment sales); removed the `sell.ask_customer` setting + `askCustomerProvider`. |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Checkout/credit overhaul (Phase A).** Credit is now defined as **any sale where `paid < total`** (not just the `credit` payment method) — so a partial payment via *any* method books the shortfall as that customer's credit. Checkout: the Amount-paid field now shows for **every** method (bugfix — previously cash-only; blank = pay in full, or 0 for the credit method), with a Change row (overpay) or **Owed** row (underpay); customer **name + phone** fields appear when the "Ask for customer" setting is on, the credit method is picked, or there's a shortfall (name required when owed>0). New nullable `sales.customer_phone` (Drift schema v2→v3 `addColumn` migration + sync mapper + Supabase `0007_customer_phone.sql`). `CreditRepository.watchCreditSales` filters `paid < total`; `CreditCustomer` gains `phone`; analytics `creditOutstanding`/`creditSales` are owed-based. Invoices "Credit" filter + badge now key off owed>0. New `sell.ask_customer` setting (`askCustomerProvider`) + Settings toggle. 63 tests pass (added partial-cash-credit test; updated analytics credit test to owed-based). NOTE: `0007` **not yet applied to live DB** (classifier blocked `db push`) — run `supabase db push`; until then syncing a sale errors on the missing `customer_phone` column (app works offline). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Admin dashboard (Flutter Web, in-repo).** Separate entry point `lib/admin/admin_main.dart` (`flutter build web -t lib/admin/admin_main.dart` — tree-shaken out of the mobile app). `AdminApp` → Supabase email/password login → role gate (`app_metadata.role=='admin'`) → dashboard: **Licenses** tab (all keys: shop/plan/status/expiry/device), **Payments** tab (license_payments, Approve→extend), **Generate key** FAB (shop_id/plan/months). All privileged ops go through a new **`admin` Edge Function** (`supabase/functions/admin/index.ts`) that verifies the admin JWT and uses the service role (actions: list_licenses, list_payments, create_license, renew_license → reuses the `0004` SQL fns; renew optionally marks the payment reconciled). Service key never touches the client. Enabled the `web` platform (`flutter create --platforms=web`). Admin web build verified (`✓ Built build/web`); 62 POS tests still pass. SETUP (user): deploy `supabase functions deploy admin`; create a Supabase auth user and set its `app_metadata.role='admin'`; run the admin app with `--dart-define-from-file=env.local.json`; deploy the web build to any static host (Cloudflare Pages/Vercel/Netlify). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Renewal payment instructions + support contact (vendor config).** New backend `app_config` table (migration `0006_app_config.sql`: key/value, public-read RLS, service-role write, seeded with placeholder KBZPay/WavePay name+number + support Viber). App: `VendorConfig` model + `VendorConfigRepository` (fetch from `app_config` when online, cache in `AppSettings`, offline fallback) + `vendorConfigProvider`. License renewal dialog now shows a "Transfer license fee to: <method> · <number> · <name>" card (with copy button) for the selected KBZPay/WavePay method, and the reference field became "Transaction ID (last 6 digits)" (digits-only, max 6). Settings gains a Support tile (Company Viber, tap-to-copy). 62 tests pass (added 3 vendor-config tests). NOTE: `0006` **not yet applied to live DB** (classifier blocks agent `db push`) — run it + edit the seeded placeholder values with your real accounts; until then the app shows no pay-to card (empty config). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Sell search/filter + shop-level stock toggle.** (1) Sell screen gains a search bar + category filter chips (own `sellSearchProvider`/`sellCategoryProvider`/`sellProductsProvider` so it doesn't share state with the Inventory tab). (2) "Track stock" shop setting (`shop.track_stock`, default on; `SettingsRepository.trackStock/setTrackStock/watchTrackStock` + `trackStockProvider`). When **off** (invoice-only): Sell hides out-of-stock marks, product editor hides qty/reorder, Inventory hides low-stock banner + badges, Analytics hides the Stock-value card, and `finalizeSale(trackStock:false)` skips the stock movement + decrement. SwitchListTile in Settings. 59 tests pass (added invoice-only finalizeSale test; smoke test overrides the new Drift `trackStock`/`categories` stream providers to avoid fake-clock query-stream timer leaks). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Data backup + hybrid license online-renewal.** (1) Backup: `BackupService` exports all business tables to a pretty JSON envelope (excludes `app_settings`/`outbox` so device id + license survive), shared via `share_plus` (→ Viber My Notes etc.); import via `file_picker` does a **replace-all** restore inside one transaction after a confirm dialog. New `BackupScreen` + Settings tile. Added deps `share_plus`, `file_picker`. (2) Hybrid license: `LicenseController.refreshOnline()` re-calls `activate` (same key+device) to pick up an admin-approved extension; License screen gains a "Check for renewal" button + a KPay/WavePay→admin-approval hint next to the existing renewal-payment recorder. 58 tests pass (added 3 backup round-trip/isolation/validation tests). NOTE: `share_plus`/`file_picker` add iOS/Android platform plugins — first run rebuilds native; document-picker/share work on-device (not in widget tests). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Credit sales surfaced in Invoices + Analytics.** Invoices: All/Credit filter chips, a credit badge (red=owed, green=settled) + customer name + "Owed" amount on credit rows. Analytics: `SaleRow` extended with `paid`+`paymentMethod`; `AnalyticsSummary` gains `creditSales`, `creditOutstanding`, and `collected` (= revenue − outstanding); two new KPI cards (Collected, Credit outstanding). `revenue` still counts full billed amount (accrual). 55 tests pass (added 1 analytics credit test; updated existing SaleRow literals via a `sale()` helper). |
| 2026-07-12 | feat | **Shop profile editor + Credit book (အကြွေး).** (1) Shop profile: `ShopProfileScreen` wired to the previously-dead Settings row (name/phone/address/receipt-footer → `saveShopProfile`, invalidates `shopProfileProvider` so receipts refresh). (2) Credit feature: new synced Drift table `credit_payments` (schemaVersion 1→2 with `onUpgrade`; sync mapper + Supabase migration `0005_credit.sql`). A credit sale reuses `sales` (`payment_method='credit'`, `customer_name`, `paid < total`); `SalesRepository` now records the payment row as the actual tender (`min(paid,total)`) not always `total`. `CreditRepository.aggregate` folds credit sales − repayments into per-customer outstanding; `CreditScreen`/`CreditCustomerScreen` (list + detail + record-repayment dialog) reachable from Settings → Credit book (keeps 5-tab nav). Checkout adds a 'credit' method with customer-name + partial "paid now" fields. 54 tests pass (added 7 credit tests). NOTE: `0005_credit.sql` **not yet applied to live DB** (classifier blocked agent `db push`); run `supabase db push` (or paste the SQL) before credit repayments will sync — feature is fully functional offline meanwhile. |
| 2026-07-12 | 4+5 | **Live backend deployed & verified** against project `gnikispsurwrmkspuisj` (GoldPOSMM). Applied migrations `0003_licensing.sql` + `0004_license_admin.sql` via `supabase db push` (0001/0002 already present, re-applied idempotently; migration tracking table now records 0001–0004). Deployed `activate` Edge Function. Enabled Anonymous sign-in (Auth config `external_anonymous_users_enabled=true`). End-to-end verification: (a) anon session → insert/select/delete on `products` succeeds (201/200/204) confirming `0002` dev-open RLS write path; (b) `activate` with seeded `DEMO-KEY-2026` → `ok:true` (shop `demo-shop`, monthly, active), bogus key → `invalid_key`. This clears the prior "pending on user / untested against live DB" NOTEs on Phases 4 & 5. NOTE: activate test bound `DEMO-KEY-2026` to throwaway device `verify-device-001`; reset before app-side demo with `update licenses set device_id=null, last_verified_at=null where key='DEMO-KEY-2026';`. Dev-open policies (`0002`) still active — drop before production. |
| 2026-07-10 | 0 | Spec created; stack = Flutter + Supabase decided. |
| 2026-07-10 | fix | Locale robustness: locale now **persisted** (AppSettings `app.locale`) via `LocaleController` (StateNotifier, default 'my') + `localeResolutionCallback` forcing the chosen locale so the device/system locale can never leak in (root cause of the transient English flip on an en-US emulator). Removed old ephemeral `localeProvider`. Fixed untranslated `settingsSync` ("Cloud sync" → "Cloud ချိတ်ဆက်မှု"). Added `create_license`/`renew_license` admin SQL (`0004_license_admin.sql`, service-role only). 47 tests pass (added 3 locale tests). NOTE: iOS simulator blocked by macOS Sequoia codesign bug (`com.apple.provenance` on Flutter.framework, system re-applies — unrelated to app code); Android emulator verified working. |
| 2026-07-10 | 1+ | Category management (deferred Phase 1 item, now done): `deleteCategory` (tombstone + outbox); categories screen (list, add/edit dialog, delete-with-confirm); product form category dropdown (uncategorized default, guards deleted categories); inventory category filter chips + `inventoryCategoryProvider`; manage-categories app-bar action. 44 tests pass (added 3 category repo tests). |
| 2026-07-10 | 7 | Hardening: i18n parity test (en/my key parity + no-empty + placeholder match — 3 tests), widget smoke test (boot → sell + 5-tab nav), global error handling (`runZonedGuarded` + `FlutterError.onError`, Supabase-init try/catch so backend failure never blocks offline), release polish (app display name "MM POS" on Android/iOS), README, security review (§13). 41 tests pass; `flutter analyze` clean. |
| 2026-07-10 | 6 | Analytics: pure `computeAnalytics` (revenue, sales count, discounts, COGS/profit, zero-filled daily series, top-N products by revenue, stock value) — 5 tests; `AnalyticsRepository` (offline reads from Drift); providers with Today/7d/30d range selector, auto-refresh on sales change. Dashboard: 4 KPI cards, fl_chart daily-revenue bar chart, top-products list. Fully offline (no backend). 37 tests pass. |
| 2026-07-10 | 5 | Licensing: pure `computeLicenseStatus` (active/grace/expired/none, 7-day grace) — 5 tests; `CachedLicense` model + `LicenseRepository` (activate via `activate` Edge Function when backend, else 14-day local trial; cache in AppSettings JSON; device-id binding; `recordRenewalPayment` → synced `license_payments` table); `LicenseController` binds `shopId` + gates selling. UI: license screen (status card, key activation, renewal-payment dialog, deactivate), settings tile with status, **read-only banner on sell + checkout blocked past grace**. Supabase: migration `0003_licensing.sql` (licenses + license_payments + RLS, `auth_shop_id()` reads app_metadata, dev seed key `DEMO-KEY-2026`), `activate` Edge Function (validates key, binds device, sets `app_metadata.shop_id`). App keeps license+sync controllers alive at launch. 32 tests pass (added 10). NOTE: Edge Function deploy + migration `0003` apply pending on user; online activation untested against live DB. |
| 2026-07-10 | 4 | Sync engine: Supabase migrations `0001_init.sql` (7 tables snake_case, indexes, shop-isolation RLS via `auth_shop_id()` JWT claim) + `0002_dev_open_policies.sql` (dev-only). Client: `SyncEngine` (outbox drain → push; pull with per-table `updated_at` cursor + last-write-wins merge), `SyncRemote` interface + `SupabaseSyncRemote`, explicit per-table `SyncTableDef` mappers (camel↔snake, ISO timestamps), sync cursors in `AppSettings`. `SyncController` (Riverpod) with connectivity_plus triggers + 5-min timer + anonymous-auth bootstrap. Settings "Cloud sync" tile (status + manual sync). Local run via `env.local.json` (gitignored) + `run.sh --dart-define-from-file`. Credentials verified live (auth health 200). 22 tests pass (added 5 sync tests: push/pull/LWW/cursor/tombstone). NOTE: end-to-end against live DB pending user applying migrations + enabling anonymous sign-in (see supabase/README.md). |
| 2026-07-10 | 3 | Invoices & printing: `ReceiptData`/`ReceiptFormatter` (pure, width-aware 58/80mm column layout — 5 tests), `AppSettings` KV table + `SettingsRepository` (printer/paper/shop config), `PrinterService` (print_bluetooth_thermal: pair/connect/write), **Burmese raster path** — `renderReceiptImage` draws the receipt via dart:ui (Noto/Pyidaungsu fallback) → ESC/POS `imageRaster` so Burmese prints on fontless printers; receipts use ASCII 'Ks' to keep money columns aligned. Invoices list + detail screens, reprint, printer settings screen (paper toggle, paired-device picker, test print), auto-print on checkout when a printer is set. Android BT permissions + iOS Bluetooth usage strings added. 17 tests pass. NOTE: on-device BT print not yet verified on real hardware (needs a paired printer). |
| 2026-07-10 | 2 | Sales: added `Sales`/`SaleItems`/`Payments` tables (sales append-only). `CartNotifier` (Riverpod) for the in-progress order, `SalesRepository.finalizeSale` — one transaction writes sale + items + payment + stock_movements + decrements stock_levels + enqueues all to Outbox. Per-shop/day invoice numbers `INV-yyyyMMdd-NNN`. Sell screen: product grid, tap-to-add, cart bar, checkout bottom sheet (qty steppers, discount, 5 payment methods incl. KBZPay/WavePay/AYAPay/CBPay, cash amount+change). 12 tests pass (added 5 checkout tests: totals/stock, discount, invoice increment, empty-cart guard, outbox). Digital payments assumed record-only for v1. |
| 2026-07-10 | 1 | Inventory: `InventoryRepository` (offline-first — writes Drift in a transaction + enqueues Outbox), `ProductWithStock` read model, Riverpod providers (products stream, search filter, low-stock count, categories), inventory list screen (search, low-stock banner + per-row stock badge, tap-to-edit), add/edit product form, demo seed (6 Myanmar minimart items). 7 tests pass (Money + repository: persist/outbox/low-stock/tombstone/shop-scoping). NOTE: category management UI still pending (repo method exists). |
| 2026-07-10 | 0 | Scaffolded Flutter app (`mm_pos`, org com.mmpos, android+ios). Added deps: riverpod, go_router, drift+sqlite3, supabase_flutter, connectivity_plus, intl, uuid, fl_chart, esc_pos_utils_plus, print_bluetooth_thermal. Built theme, Money value object, Env config, l10n (en/my) with ARB + gen_l10n, Drift DB skeleton (categories/products/stock_levels/stock_movements/outbox with SyncColumns), Riverpod providers, go_router shell (5 tabs, rail on tablet / bottom bar on phone), 5 placeholder feature screens. `flutter analyze` clean; Money unit tests pass. Supabase init is gated on --dart-define so app runs fully offline. |
